#### sample calibration file ###
# these files are parsed with the Python ConfigParser and use an ini-style format
# # or ; can be used for comments
# each calibration file can contain one or more sections [section name] which denote one calibration
# the variables making up the calibration can be given as name=value or name:value
# see below for which values to supply


#short name
[example]

#additional description for the GUI
tooltip = this is an example calibration for testing

# which color channel to use red, blue, green for colered images or grey for greyscale images
channel = red

# argument of the function for dose calculation
# chose "netOD" to use net optical density as argument of the function (arg=log_10[(phi_0 - background)/(value-background)])
# or "direct" to use raw pixel values arg=value-background
argument=netOD

#a background level, to be subtracted from everything
background = 0.0

#the lowest black level that can be measured. For netOD everything below this value will be coerced to this value
black = 10.0

# function to calculate the dose
# currently two functions are implemented: the exp_poly: p1*arg+p2*arg^p3 and linear: p1 + p2*arg
function = exp_poly
p1=7.15949
p2=10.1902
p3=2.5932
