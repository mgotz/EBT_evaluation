#### sample calibration file ###
# these files are parsed with the Python ConfigParser and use an ini-style format
# # or ; can be used for comments
# each calibration file can contain one or more sections [section name] which denote one calibration
# the variables making up the calibration can be given as name=value or name:value
# see below for which values to supply


#short name
[example]

#additional description for the GUI
tooltip = this is an example calibration for testing

# which color channel to use red, blue, green for colered images or grey for greyscale images
# use a comma seperates multiple channels for multi channel methods
channel = red

# argument of the function for dose calculation
# chose "netOD" to use net optical density as argument of the function (arg=log_10[(phi_0 - background)/(value-background)])
# "direct" to use raw pixel values arg=value-background
# or "relativeNetOD" to use the ratio of the netOD of two channels
argument=netOD

#a background level, to be subtracted from everything (optional)
background = 0.0

#the lowest black level that can be measured. For netOD everything below this value will be coerced to this value (optional, creates warning, though)
black = 10.0

#the unit this calibration results in (optional, defaults to Gy), can also be an empty string
unit = Gy

# function to calculate the dose
# currently the functions are implemented: 
# the "exp_poly": p1*arg+p2*arg^p3 
# the "linear": p1 + p2*arg
# and the "rational": p1 + p2/(p3+arg)
function = exp_poly
p1=7.15949
p2=10.1902
p3=2.5932
